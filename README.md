Hi, my name is Vanderlei Miguel;

  I have 15 years of experience in the areas of automation, maintenance and engineering, developing electrical projects, PLC programming, HMI, drives and industrial robots, using ladder, stl and manufacturer-specific language, specification and material budgets, knowledge multiplier and leadership of internal projects team.
  I am currently in the process of transitioning into a career in web development, aligning the foundations and experience I have in the hardskills and softskills in the area of industrial programming for web development.
